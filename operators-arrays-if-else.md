```java
String[] names = {"Andrew", "Bob"}
if (names[1].equals("Bob") && names.length == 2) {
    System.out.println("foo");
} else if (names[1].equals("Andrew")) {
    System.out.println("bar");
} else {
    System.out.println("baz");
}
```

Question 1: What will this code output and why?

Question 2: In the above code, how could you change it to make it print "bar" instead?

Question 3: How would you make it print "baz"?
